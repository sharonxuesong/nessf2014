\section{Summary of Project and Orignal Plans}
\vspace{-5pt}

Our project is on improving the radial velocity precision...
% define HET/HRS, MINERVA, CHIRON

In our original proposal, our plans include:

(1) removing the RV systematics caused by telluric lines;

(2) validating the calibrator: the iodine atlas;

(3) improving the wavelength-dependent statistical weighting;

(4) improving data reduction and instrument modeling.

We have made significant progress on all fronts, as detailed in the
next section. We plan to finish the on-going work described in
Section~2 before the end of this funding cycle, and we lay out our
plans for the next one, starting September 1 2015, in Section~3.

\section{Progress and Achievements}
\vspace{-5pt}

We describe our progress on item (1) in Section~\ref{sec:tell}, item
(2) in Section~\ref{sec:fts} and item (3) in Section~\ref{sec:ip}. Our
new work described in Section~\ref{sec:newrv} address both (3) and
(4).

We plan to publish the work described in Section~2.1 through 2.3 in
two papers (in prep.), and the work of Section~1.3 is in the form of a
new code, written in {\it Python}, that is made available to the
public and will also be presented and documented in peer-reviewed
literature. Most of the work described here was presented in a Solar,
Stellar, and Planetary Seminar talk at Harvard/CfA in October 2014,
and will be presented in future meetings such as the Extreme Precise
Radial Velocity Workshop in July 2015 at Yale and a couple of more
other future meetings in 2015--2016.

\subsection{Telluric-Free Stellar Templates and Forward Modeling of
  Telluric Lines}\label{sec:tell}
\vspace{-5pt}

Earth's atmosphere creates absorption lines (telluric lines) in the
observed spectra based on which we derive the RVs of the stars. These
telluric lines impersonate stellar lines but do not exhibit Doppler
shifts, and thus they creates a bias to the measured RV, at a level of
at least $\sim1$~\mps. Our original plan was to improve the mask for
flagging the telluric-contaminated pixels as bad ones, and also to
tune the fitter in our modeling code to adjust to this change.

However, during the past year, we have found that more elaborate
solutions rather than simply `ignoring' the telluric pixels would
be more efficient in correcting the biases. As a result, we have made
two major progresses:

(a) We have created, for the first time, stellar spectral templates
that are free of telluric contamination fro Keck observations.

(b) We are incorporating a full forward-modeling module into the
existing RV code to model the telluric lines in the epoch
observations (work in final step).

Figure~\ref{fig:tell} illustrates the improvements made by these two
new efforts. Similarly to Figure~1 shown in our original proposal,
this is the RMS of RVs of a standard star observed by Keck. Different
from the old Figure~1, this set of RVs were derived from a particular
stellar template observation which had large amount of telluric
contamination (i.e.\ deep water lines caused by humid observing
condition). Our old approach of masking telluric pixels would bring
only marginal improvement on these RVs. However, with our
telluric-free stellar template and preliminary modeling
implementation, a significant portion of the aliasing signal caused by
the telluric lines is successfully removed (the trend shown in the
third panel). We also see reduction of powers in the periodogram at
harmonics of a sidereal year, which means that for future planet
detection, successful removal of telluric-induced aliasing signal
would boost detection confidence level or even reveal planet signals
that otherwise would not be able emerge in the periodogram.

    y-axis).} 
  \vspace{-8pt}  
  \label{fig:tell}
\end{figure}


We have also applied our code to a couple more test targets at Keck,
and we are confident that, with telluric-free templates and full
incorporation of telluric lines in the forward-modeling process, we
will be able improve the RV precision and accuracy for many targets at
Keck, especially the stars which have low-mass, low-RV amplitude
planets, such as some of the \kepler\ targets.

We will publish the work described in this section to share our
methods and findings with the broader community, and moreover, as a
result of this work, I am invited to host a discussion session on
treating the telluric contamination in precise RV work at the upcoming
Extreme Precise Radial Velocity Workshop in July 2015 at Yale.

Here is a more detailed description of the progress, including on-going work:

For (a): Stellar spectral templates are derived based on observations
of the target star (without an iodine cell) and thus is also subject
to telluric contamination. We have created a pipeline for producing
telluric-free stellar template for Keck (also adaptable for other
instruments). Using the telluric simulation package TERRASPEC (written
by Chad Bender, Penn State, based on the HITRAN molecular line
database; ZZZ citation), we are able to determine the oxygen and water
column densities based on the red portion of the spectra near
7000\AA\ and construct telluric line model for the iodine region of
the spectra. Then for each step of spectral modeling in the process of
template creation, we are able to model the telluric lines and
therefore remove it form the end product.

We are now collaborating with the CHIRON group at Yale (Debra Fischer
and Matt Giguere) to provide them with a telluric-free $\tau$ Ceti
template, to enhance the RV accuracy and precision on this important
RV standard star for better understanding of stellar activity induced
RV signal.

For (b): For the epoch observation (with the iodine cell), we have
a implemented basic function of telluric line modeling in our RV code as
a first step, where the water column density would be a fixed value
for all observations. We are constructing the module which would fit
for the water column density for each night and construct different
telluric models. This would be the final step to fully modeling the
telluric lines in RV observations, and thus provide the maximal
capability of removing the biases within the frame of our current RV
code (for work beyond this, see Section~\ref{sec:newrv}).


%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\vspace{-10pt}
\subsection{Evidence for Changes of Iodine Calibration Cells and Solutions}\label{sec:fts}
\vspace{-5pt}

A ``ground truth" iodine atlas is crucial for the precise iodine
radial velocimetry. It is used for modeling the observed iodine lines
in the stellar$+$iodine RV observation to anchor the absolute
wavelengths and the spectrograph response function. Such a ``ground
truth" atlas is normally obtained through a Fourier Transform
Spectrometer (FTS). Our previous work has revealed potential problems
with FTS atlases, and in our original proposal, we promised to use the
TS12 arm of the Tull spectrograph at McDonald Observatory to validate
the qualities of the FTS iodine atlases for HET/HRS, MINERVA, and the
McDonald 2.7m (all three are important current or future RV
instruments in the northern hemisphere).

In October 2014, the TS12 observations were successfully carried
out. All data are reduced and we have made comparisons between the
TS12 spectra and FTS scans. For the 2.7m cell, its TS12 spectrum
matches very well to its FTS atlas, again (together with the 2.1m cell
data from 2013) proving that TS12 is an appropriate tool for
validating FTS atlases. The TS12 spectra for the MINERVA cell is also
ready, and right now we are waiting for the FTS expert on our team to
reduce the MINERVA FTS data for comparison, which is expected to be
done before June (first light of the proto-type MINERVA spectrograph).

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}

    $R=60,000$ (typical RV observation resolution) for comparison
    purposes.}
  \vspace{-8pt}  
  \label{fig:fts}
\end{wrapfigure}

Finally, for the HET/HRS iodine cell, we have taken its TS12 spectra
at three different temperatures (50, 60, and 70$\degree$C; the RV
working temperature for the cell is 70$\degree$C). Our main findings
(both are first-time discoveries for iodine RV work) are as follows:

(a) Temperature change (5--10$\degree$C) in iodine cell matters: The
long suspected temperature-induced iodine spectrum change was finally
confirmed, which is seen very visibly among the TS12 spectra taken at
three different temperatures. Based on our NIST FTS atlases taken at
two different temperatures, temperature change on the order of
10$\degree$C should not induce visible line changes. However, we
suspected issues with temperature control and data calibration with
the NIST atlases, and the TS12 spectra confirmed our suspicion and
proved that temperature on the order of even 5$\degree$C would have
manifested as significant line changes (for precise RV purposes).

(b) The HET/HRS cell very likely has changed over time: The TS12
spectra match better with the more recent but potentially problematic
NIST FTS atlas, which had worse $\chi^2_\nu$ fit than the old KPNO
atlas. This is completely unexpected and suggests that: the NIST atlas
was perhaps taken at the correct temperature (i.e.\ the KPNO atlas was
at a lower and wrong temperature) but the worse fit was caused by
calibration errors in the atlas; and/or the temperature or optical
depth of the cell changes over the course of 20 years, and hence the
differences between these three spectra (Figure~\ref{fig:fts}); and
further more, it is possible that the temperature/optical depth of the
cell changes on a much shorter scale during the observing seasons, and
most of the time it stays at a temperature/optical depth that is
similar to the one when the KPNO atlas was taken (e.g.\ actually at a
lower temperature though thought to be at 70$\degree$C).

To answer these questions, and also to go beyond diagnosis and
actually resolve the issue of a changing cell, we have found a
possible third venue that might provide reliable, ultra-high
resolution, and wavelength calibrated iodine atlas -- a theoretical
code that computes iodine transmission spectrum (at any specified
temperature) based on both physics and empirical calibrations
(IodineSpec5, zzz citation). We have successfully installed and
learned the code, and properly translated the code output into
practical astrophysical units and to account for optical depth
differences. We are now using the code to diagnose the HET/HRS cell to
study whether the cell temperature or optical depth changes (as
reflected by actual HET/HRS observations instead of FTS/TS12 atlas
observations), and to explore the possibility of using the theoretical
output as the new ``ground-truth" atlas.

We will publish these results and any ``ground-truth" iodine atlases
or spectra we derive for any instrument in this work in the near
future.

% old proposal
\begin{comment}
% An overview of awesomeness of finding low-mass exoplanets.
The great synergy between NASA's \kepler\ mission and the ground-based
radial velocity (RV) surveys has made ground-breaking discoveries of
exoplanets, including many interesting low-mass \citep{marcy2014} and
likely rocky planets \citep{weiss2013} such as Kepler-78b, the first
exoplanet known to have radius and mass very close to Earth's
\citep{howard2013,pepe2013}. In the post-Kepler era, radial
velocimetry will continue to play a key role in validating Kepler
candidates and measuring their masses, as well as discovering
exoplanets independently.

% But... precise RV is yet to be more precise.
However, the current RV precision ($\gtrsim
0.5$--1~\mps)\footnote{The photon-limited precision of the leading RV
  instruments (HARPS and Keck) is $\sim$0.5--1~\mps\ for bright stars,
  while in reality, there is almost always some extra error, i.e.~the
  ``RV jitter", comprised of systematic errors and unaccounted
  stellar-activity signals. For example, the RMS of RV residuals
  against best-fit model for the Kepler-78b system is $\sim 2.5$~\mps,
  with an RV jitter of $\sim 2.1$~\mps, while the photon-limited error
  for the star is $<2$~\mps\ \citep{howard2013,pepe2013}.} is limiting
our ability to detect exoplanets with even lower masses or rocky
planets orbiting farther out, especially in or near the Habitable
Zone. Breaking this limit is critical for enriching the diversity of
the exoplanet ensemble towards lower masses, and it is a necessary
step for finding Earth analogs in the Habitable Zone around Sun-like
stars, which requires an RV precision of $\sim$0.1~\mps.

% What we propose to do
\textbf{We propose to improve the RV precision of several leading RV
  instruments by eliminating $>1$~\mps\ of systematic errors, with the
  aim to find the lowest mass exoplanets.} We will improve the RV
precision of Keck and the 9.2m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET), which are
the leading facilities for extensive \kepler\ follow-up observations
as well as independent large and deep RV surveys. Our work will also
improve the RV precision of two instruments on small telescopes:
CHIRON and the upcoming MINiature Exoplanet RV Array
(\minerva). Designed for carrying out dedicated surveys with extremely
high RV precision, CHIRON and \minerva\ will provide valuable high
cadence data on nearby and bright stars, which are the best targets
for planetary atmosphere characterization studies.

\textbf{With improved RV precision, we will revisit and perform
  dynamic analysis on systems with multiple planets, especially the
  ones with small RV amplitudes, such as 55 Cancri, GJ 876, upsilon
  Andromedae, and GJ 581.}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{-10pt}
\section{Expected Scientific Outcome and Impact}
\vspace{-5pt}
% Keck
\textbf{Science with \keck: } The primary instrument we work with is
the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) on Keck I (current RV
precision $\sim$1~\mps). Among the 432 RV discovered exoplanets,
\keck\ has contributed the most ($\sim$200). It has also contributed
to a great number of mass measurements of confirmed \kepler\ planets
--- in particular, \textit{most} of the low mass ones
\citep[e.g.,][]{gautier2012,gilliland2013,howard2013,marcy2014}. However,
its current RV precision is limiting its ability to detect even lower
mass planets or planets with the same mass but orbiting farther out
(see, e.g., the marginal or null detections of the confirmed
\kepler\ planets in \citealt{marcy2014}).

% Lots of low mass Kepler planets
Our work will improve the RV precision of \keck, and thus extend the
lower mass limit of the current exoplanet sample. This is especially
promising when considering the large pool of low mass planet
candidates that \kepler\ provides: among the $\sim$1600 KOIs with
transit signals suggesting a planet radius $<$ 2 Earth radii, there
are $\sim$260 whose host stars have \kepler\ magnitude $< 13$ ---
bright enough for Keck to follow up (vs.~fewer than 10 such targets
with \kepler\ mag $< 9$ and thus accessible to HARPS-N; exoplanets.org).

% Multi-planet systems to improve with Keck
Meanwhile, better RV precision will improve the characterization of
multiple-planet systems, especially the ones that host challenging low
RV amplitude planets/candidates and with potentially very active
dynamic interactions. Such systems are valuable samples for studying
the architecture of exoplanet systems and planet formation. We will
reanalyze the RV data and perform dynamic analyses on several of these
systems, including the GJ 876 system, which is the closest
multi-planet systems to the Sun and the only known exoplanet system
with a triple conjunction \citep{marcy2001,rivera2005,rivera2010}; the
$\upsilon$ Andromedae system, the first multi-planet system discovered
around main-sequence star \citep{butler1999,wright2009,curiel2011}; as
well as the GJ 581 system, which hosts the first claimed
terrestrial-mass exoplanet in the Habitable Zone (\citealt{vogt2010},
though it is under debate,
e.g.~\citealt{gregory2011,vogt2012,robertson2013}).

% HET
\textbf{Science with \hrs: } We will also improve the RV precision of
the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS) on HET (current RV precision
$\sim$3--5~\mps). With multiple ongoing upgrades on \hrs\ (expected to
finish in Summer 2014), its throughput will be improved by a factor of
$\sim$5, also with the promise of higher RV precision of the new
HRS. HET will become the second telescope, besides Keck, capable of
extensive RV follow-up on planet candidates discovered by
\kepler. This will also benefit other planet search programs on
\hrs\ such as surveys on long-period planets and multiple-planet
systems.

% Minerva and CHIRON
\textbf{MINERVA and CHIRON: } The upcoming \minerva\ will consist of
an array of four 0.7m telescopes and a vacuum-sealed, highly-stable
spectrograph (schedule to be online in 2015). It will perform
dedicated RV monitoring on a carefully-selected ensemble of nearby
stars. It is expected to discover $\gtrsim 10$ Earth- to
super-Earth-size planets with orbital period of 1--100 days around
nearby stars, with 3--5 expected to be in the Habitable Zones of their
host stars \citep{bottom2013,hogstrom2013}. Our work will prepare
\minerva\ to meet its targeted long-term RV precision of $\sim
0.8$~\mps.

CHIRON (on the 1.5m SMARTS telescope at CTIO) has demonstrated
short-term RV stability of $\sim0.5$~\mps\ on $\tau$ Ceti
\citep{chiron2013}. The improvement we propose will help CHIRON
achieve long-term RV stability below 1~\mps\ and help validate or
characterize the potential planetary systems around $\tau$ Ceti
\citep{tuomi2013} and $\alpha$ Centauri B
\citep{dumusque2012,hatzes2013}, whose planets (candidates) have RV
amplitudes on the order of $\sim 1$~\mps\ or even smaller.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{-10pt}
\section{Methodology}
\vspace{-5pt}

% overall
We have identified several underlying causes for RV systematic errors
through our pilot study. Some of these errors are being recognized and
studied in detail \textit{for the very first time}. A few of them
enter the RV error budget at a $\sim 1$~\mps\ or even larger level,
and thus they set the floor for long-term RV precision at 1~\mps\ if
not carefully studied and corrected for. We will determine the first
comprehensive error budget of iodine radial velocimetry.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\vspace{-10pt}
\subsection{Removing the Systematics Caused by Telluric
  Lines}\label{sec:tell}
\vspace{-5pt}

% telluric lines act like stellar line impostors but don't shift
In precise iodine radial velocimetry, RVs are measured from the
differential shift of stellar lines between two stellar spectra.
Since all current RV instruments are ground-based, the stellar spectra
inevitably contain telluric absorption lines as from the light's
travel through Earth's atmosphere. These telluric lines impersonate
stellar lines but do not exhibit Doppler shifts caused by the Earth's
barycentric motion ($\sim$a few to tens of k\mps) and the exoplanets. The
resulting ``peak-pulling" effect in the iodine analysis (see,
e.g.~\citealt{wright2013}) then manifests as an annual systematic
signal.

% before we thought it was ok, then we recognized and showed for the
% first time that it's not
For years, such problems caused by telluric lines were thought to have
been suppressed to a negligible level, because there are only few
telluric bands mostly with shallow lines within the working wavelength
region of iodine radial velocimetry (5000\AA--6000\AA). However, as
the RV precision improved over time and has approached
$\sim1$~\mps\ and better, the adverse effects of telluric lines have
emerged and become one of the current bottlenecks of precise radial
velocimetry. \textbf{This is demonstrated \textit{for the first time}
  through our preliminary study, and with some initial effort in
  telluric line masking, we were able to eliminate a visible amount of
  the systematic RV errors}, which is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:tell}.

\begin{figure}[thb]
  \vspace{-3pt}
  \begin{center}
%    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{telluric}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{telluric2}
  \end{center}
  \vspace{-25pt}  
  \caption{Measured precise radial velocities of a standard star
    observed with \keck\ as a function of barycentric correction
    (i.e.~Earth's radial velocity away from the target). Our
    preliminary treatment of telluric lines has removed over
    1~\mps\ systematic noise (panel 3; note the change in scale on
    y-axis).} 
  \vspace{-8pt}  
  \label{fig:tell}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:tell} shows that the long-term ($> 5$ years) RV RMS of
an RV standard star observed by \keck, HD 185144 ($\sigma$ Draconis),
is reduced from 2.66~\mps\ to 2.43~\mps\ --- \textbf{an RMS of
  1.08~\mps\ is removed from the RV jitter}
($\sqrt{2.66^2-2.43^2}$). The last panel of Figure~\ref{fig:tell}
illustrates the removed systematic errors, which has a clear annual
signal. The rest of the RV jitter may be due to residual telluric line
effects, intrinsic stellar jitter, other unknown systematic errors, or
even low RV amplitude planets.

% this is only the beginning - lots of improvements can be done!
We will further reduce the systematics caused by telluric lines in
several ways. For example, currently we are masking out the telluric
lines by using a naive simulated telluric spectrum based on the
elevation of Mauna Kea with nominal atmospheric compositions and
conditions. In the future we will employ empirical masks derived from
B star observations. Another example is that the RV extraction code is
not yet optimized to consistently produce a good fit in regions where
some of the pixels are being masked out due to telluric lines,
especially for the cases with large barycentric velocity shifts. A
more carefully-tuned $\chi^2$ minimization algorithm will allow us to
recover reliable RVs from \textit{all} segments of the iodine-laced
stellar spectrum, including those with significant telluric
contamination.

% also HET, MINERVA and CHIRON!
This work will naturally improve the RV precision of \hrs\ and
\minerva, as they share essentially the same RV extraction code
inherited from the \keck\ pipeline. Moreover, the sites of \hrs\ and
\minerva\ are at much lower elevations than Mauna Kea, which means
that the telluric line contamination probably causes more severe
systematic errors. We will also work with the CHIRON team to implement
the treatment for telluric lines to help CHIRON achieve higher
long-term RV precision.

\subsection{Improving the Wavelength-Dependent Statistical Weighting}\label{sec:vank}
\vspace{-5pt}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.45\textwidth}

  \caption{RV RMS of HD 185144 before (gray) and after (black) weighting.} 
  \vspace{-8pt}  
  \label{fig:vank}
\end{wrapfigure}

% what is weighting and its importance
The application of wavelength-dependent statistical weights is the
``secret sauce" of precise iodine radial velocimetry. It evaluates the
RV performance of each wavelength region (an ``RV chunk") across
observations and assigns them statistical weights before computing the
final mean RV. It also adjusts for the wavelength-dependent systematic
offsets and rejects outlier chunks with poor RV RMS
performance. Figure~\ref{fig:vank} illustrates the crucial role of
this weighting scheme in precise radial velocimetry.

% what's 'wrong' with it
Through our preliminary work with telluric lines, we discovered that
the weighting procedure does not give proper treatment to the
telluric-contaminated chunks. It does not incorporate any prior
knowledge on the intrinsic quality of chunks, and consequently, the
telluric-contaminated ones tend to be either brutally rejected or
taken in almost equally as the clean chunks.

% what we plan to do
\textbf{We propose to improve the statistical weighting by
  incorporating prior knowledge on the intrinsic quality of different
  wavelength regions.} Our work will extend beyond implementing proper
treatment for the telluric regions: the current weighting procedure is
purely a post-RV-reduction outlier rejection process, and we will
increase its power by exploiting more prior knowledge on each chunk,
such as the amount of Doppler information content, the signal-to-noise
ratio, and instrumental effects.

A ``ground truth" iodine atlas is crucial for the precise iodine radial
velocimetry. It is used for modeling the observed iodine lines in the
stellar$+$iodine RV observation to anchor the absolute wavelengths and
the spectrograph response function. Such a ``ground truth" atlas is
normally obtained through a Fourier Transform Spectrometer
(FTS). However, our recent work has revealed potential problems with
the quality of FTS iodine atlases.

We took a new FTS atlas of the \hrs\ iodine cell at NIST and compared
it with the old one (taken at KPNO in 1993), which showed that they
differ significantly in terms of wavelength scales and line
shapes. The RV jitter of the RV standard star HD 185144 (observed with
\hrs) is $\sim5$~\mps\ when we use the new FTS atlas
vs.~$\sim4$~\mps\ with the old one. This calls into questions of how
``true" any existing FTS iodine atlas really is, and demands for an
independent method to validate them. \textbf{We propose to validate
  the quality of the FTS iodine atlases for the new \hrs\ and
  \minerva, and also for CHIRON and other RV instruments if
  necessary.}

We have found a method to independently validate the quality of FTS
iodine atlas, which is to take a high-resolution echelle spectrum of
the iodine cell in the ``real wavelength space" (as opposed to in
Fourier space with FTS). We used the TS12 arm of the Tull Spectrograph
at the McDonald Observatory 2.7m telescope, which has the matching
spectral resolution to an FTS ($R \sim 500,000$). For our pilot study,
we used the iodine cell at the McDonald 2.1m telescope, whoese FTS
atlas was also taken at KPNO in 1993 and thus can represent the
quality of the KPNO FTS atlases.

\end{wrapfigure}

Figure~\ref{fig:fts} illustrates the comparison between the FTS iodine
atlas and the echelle spectrum (zoomed into a 2\AA\ chunk). It shows
that, when convolved down to resolution $R=60,000$ (typical resolution
of an star$+$iodine RV observation), the difference between the KPNO
scan and the echelle spectrum is consistent with photon-limited
errors and potential errors in flat fielding and scattered light
removal.

This demonstrates that we have found an independent and reliable
method to validate any FTS iodine atlas. Current and upcoming RV
instruments such as the new \hrs, \minerva, and CHIRON will need
validation for their FTS iodine atlases to eliminate one risk factor
that could potentially compromise the RV precision, which is our
proposed work here.

\subsection{Improving Data Reduction and Instrument Modeling}\label{sec:ip}
\vspace{-5pt}

We propose to improve the data reduction pipeline of \hrs\ in
preparation for its upgrade (schedule to finish in Summer 2014) and
also for the upcoming project \minerva. The new \hrs\ will have a new spectral
format that is similar to CHIRON and \minerva. This new format will
have five parallel images for each echelle order due to the
implementation of an image slicer, and this poses a challenge to data
reduction, especially for flat fielding. With our experience of
setting up data reduction pipeline for the current
\hrs\ \citep{wang2012} and our close collaboration with the CHIRON
group, we will produce a pipeline for the new \hrs\ and
\minerva\ to ensure the delivery of high RV precision.

Another factor that is limiting the current precision of \hrs\ is the
modeling of the spectrograph response function (SRF). This is probably
not a dominant issue for \keck, since the SRF of HIRES has been
studied in detail and modeled successfully. However, for the fiber-fed
\hrs\ and \minerva, the SRF will be significantly different and
require more careful study on fiber spectroscopy. We have acquired
on-sky and engineering test data with \hrs\ designed to address this
issue, as well as the issue of modal noise, which is also unique to
fiber-fed spectrographs.

\section{Relevance to NASA's Objectives and Missions}
\vspace{-5pt}

Broadly, our investigation addresses one of the science
objectives of NASA SMD, ``Discover the origin, structure, evolution
and destiny of the universe and search for Earth-like planets".

More specifically, this proposal is directly and closely relevant to
the Astrophysics Research Program, theme (iii) Exoplanet Exploration,
in the solicitation: \textbf{(1)``to search for planets and planetary
  systems about nearby stars in our Galaxy":} This is the direct
science goal of our work. \textbf{(2) ``to determine the properties of
  those stars that harbor planetary systems":} We will acquire high
resolution spectra on planet host stars with \keck\ and \hrs\ for,
e.g. the \kepler\ stars, as required by the RV technique. Improved RV
precision will also help better understanding stellar activities and
stellar RV jitter. \textbf{(3)``to determine the percentage of planets
  that are in or near the Habitable Zone of a wide variety of stars
  and to measure their orbits":} Improved RV precision of \keck\ and
\hrs\ will enable more detections of potentially rocky exoplanets in
the Habitable Zone of their host stars, which is also the immediate
goal of project \minerva.

Our work will support current and future NASA missions: We will
enhance the scientific outcome of the \textbf{\textit{Kepler} mission}
through follow-up programs such as candidate validation, planetary
mass measurements, and TTV target follow-up. In the future, \keck,
\hrs, and \minerva\ can all contribute significantly to the follow-up
programs of \textbf{TESS}. Improved radial velocimetry will find more
super Earths and Earth analogs, which are the primary targets for
\textbf{JWST} for planetary atmosphere characterization.
