	Selling Points
####################################################
Overall: Our work is important and necessary for discovering low-mass exoplanets.

- Improved Keck RV precision!
	- Synergy with CHIRON
	- Revisit systems like:
		GJ 581
		alpha Cen B
		tau Ceti
		ups And?
		TTV targets like HIP 14810
- Bring another 10-m class telescope to Keck precision! which is also prep work for the awesome project Minerva.

	Potential Weaknesses to Shore Up
####################################################
- Why bother doing this while we have HARPS-North?
	There are very few good low-mass planet system candidates have bright enough host stars for HARPS-N to follow up. 10m telescopes win!
- How does Minerva compete with HARPS-S and HARPS-N?
	Cadence! Minerva will be fully robotic and dedicated to do high-cadence survey.
- Really, how many Kepler Earth-like planet candidates are there left for Keck to confirm?
	On the order of hundreds even considering magnitude limits! A lot!
- There are so many aspects in improving RV, is this the current bottleneck and the most important next thing to do?
	The proposed work deals with systematic effects that have ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED, but just not removed! This is the natural next step! Especially we are talking about annual signal here.

Finding Earth-like Exoplanets with Precise Radial Velocities
Finding Habitable Rocky Exoplanets with Precise Radial Velocities - "Rocky" might annoy people
Stepping towards Discovery of Earth 2.0 with Precise Radial Velocities - "stepping towards" is BAD
Enabling Discoveries of Habitable Rocky Exoplanets with Precise Radial Velocities

Change 'Velocity' to 'Velocimetry', since we're talking about a method here.

Improving Radial Velocimetry for the Lowest Mass Exoplanets
Finding the Lowest Mass Exoplanets with Improved Radial Velocimetry - this is it!

	Misc Info & Notes
####################################################
Ok to use the term 'post-Kepler era', but use it in a positive tune.

First light instrument for GMT: G-CLEF for precise RV
http://www.gmto.org/g-clef.html

According to exoplanets.org, there are 1691 KOIs with
MASS[mearth] < 4.0
LOTS of small-mass exoplanets awaiting confirmation!
For R<2 Rearth KOIs:
KP<9, there are only 6.
KP<13, there are 267.
KP < 14, there are 632.

For M<4 Mearth KOIs (I guess these two are roughly equivalent):
KP<9, there are only 6.
KP<13, there are 264.

elevation of McDonald Observatory = 6790 ft
elevation of Keck Observatory = 13599 ft

On tau Ceti:
single measurement sigma = 0.82 m/s
12 nights nightly binned sigma = 0.43 m/s
rms of 12 nights = 0.53 m/s
The highest precision and RV stability achieved with iodine RV work.
