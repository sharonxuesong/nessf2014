	Potential Weaknesses to Shore Up
####################################################
- Why bother doing this while we have HARPS-North?
	There are very few good low-mass planet system candidates have bright enough host stars for HARPS-N to follow up. 10m telescopes win!
- How does Minerva compete with HARPS-S and HARPS-N?
	Cadence! Minerva will be fully robotic and dedicated to do high-cadence survey.
- Really, how many Kepler Earth-like planet candidates are there left for Keck to confirm?
	On the order of hundreds even considering magnitude limits! A lot!
- There are so many aspects in improving RV, is this the current bottleneck and the most important next thing to do?
	The proposed work deals with systematic effects that have ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED, but just not removed! This is the natural next step! Especially we are talking about annual signal here.

SHORT VERSION:

The great synergy between NASA’s Kepler mission and the ground-based radial velocity (RV) surveys has made ground-breaking discoveries of exoplanets, including many interesting low- mass and likely rocky planets such as Kepler-78b, the first exoplanet known to have radius and mass very close to Earth’s. However, the current precision of radial velocimetry (~0.5–1 m/s) is limiting our ability to detect exoplanets with even lower masses or rocky planets further out in the orbit, especially in or near the Habitable Zone. We propose to improve the RV precision of several leading RV instruments (all using the iodine radial velocimetry), with the aim to find the lowest mass exoplanets. 

Our work will eliminate > 1 m/s from the RV systematic errors and improve the precision of these instruments to a new level: (1) Keck and the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET), which are the two leading facilities for extensive Kepler follow-up and independent RV surveys;  CHIRON and the upcoming MINERVA, which are designed to carry out high-cadence RV surveys on an interesting sample of nearby stars such as tau Ceti and alpha Centauri. We will also revisit and perform dynamic analysis on systems with multiple planets, especially the ones with small RV amplitudes, such as tau Ceti, GJ 876, upsilon Andromedae, and GJ 581.  

We have identified several contributing factors to RV systematic errors through our pilot study, some of which are being recognized and studied in detail for the very first time for precise radial velocimetry with iodine. We propose to work on: removal of RV systematic errors / annual jitter caused by the Earth's atmospheric absorption (telluric lines); improvements in wavelength-dependent statistical weighting in spectrum for RV extraction; validation of the RV calibrator, the iodine atlas, using high-resolution echelle spectrograph; and improvements in data reduction and instrumental effect modeling for fiber-fed RV instruments.

Our work is closely related to NASA's scientific objectives (quotes are the objectives of the solicitation): Precise radial velocimetry aims at searching "for planets and planetary systems about nearby stars in our Galaxy", and our work is directly related to determining "the percentage of planets that are in or near the Habitable Zone of a wide variety of stars and to measure their orbits" since improved RV precision will yield more detection of Earth- and super-Earth-like exoplanets. Our work will help to "determine the properties of those stars that harbor planetary systems" through the high-resolution spectra taken during RV observations and also through a better understanding of stellar RV signals thanks to a lower RV systematic errors. We directly support the Kepler mission, and in the future, TESS, through follow-up programs.

COMPREHENSIVE VERSION:

Background: The great synergy between NASA’s Kepler mission and the ground-based radial velocity (RV) surveys has made ground-breaking discoveries of exoplanets, including many interesting low- mass and likely rocky planets such as Kepler-78b, the first exoplanet known to have radius and mass very close to Earth’s. However, the current precision of radial velocimetry (~0.5–1 m/s) is limiting our ability to detect exoplanets with even lower masses or rocky planets further out in the orbit, especially in or near the Habitable Zone.
Objective: We propose to improve the RV precision of several leading RV instruments (all using the iodine radial velocimetry), with the aim to find the lowest mass exoplanets. Our work will eliminate > 1 m/s from the RV systematic errors and improve the precision of these instruments to a new level.

Expected Science Outcome and Significance: The primary instrument we work with is HIRES on Keck. Keck/HIRES has contributed to a great number of validation and mass measurements of Kepler planets - including most of the small and low-mass ones with radius smaller than 2 Earth radii. It has also contributed the most to the sample of RV-discovered exoplanets (~200 out of 432). Bringing its RV precision to a new level will bring new discoveries of exoplanets with ever lower masses. Moreover, with improved RV precision, we will revisit and perform dynamic analysis on systems with multiple planets, especially the ones with small RV amplitudes, such as tau Ceti, GJ 876, upsilon Andromedae, and GJ 581. 

We will also improve the RV precision of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). Upon finish of its hardware upgrade this summer, HET will become the second large telescope that is capable of extensive Kepler follow-up programs. Ensuring that its RV precision is comparable to that of Keck will maximize the science return on the Kepler legacy, and will also greatly benefit the current on-going RV surveys at these large telescopes. Moreover, our work has great synergy with two other precise RV instruments on smaller telescopes, CHIRON and the upcoming project MINERVA, which carry out dedicated, high-cadence RV surveys on interesting nearby stars such as tau Ceti and alpha Centauri A/B.

Methodology: We have identified several contributing factors to RV systematic errors through our pilot study, some of which are being recognized and studied in detail for the very first time for precise radial velocimetry with iodine. Some of these factors contribute to the RV error budget at ~1 m/s level, and thus they set the floor of long-term RV precision at 1 m/s if not carefully studied and corrected for. We propose to work on: removal of RV systematic errors / annual jitter caused by the Earth's atmospheric absorption (telluric lines); improvements in wavelength-dependent statistical weighting in spectrum for RV extraction; validation of the RV calibrator, the iodine atlas, using high-resolution echelle spectrograph; and improvements in data reduction and instrumental effect modeling for fiber-fed RV instruments.

OLD VERSION:

The synergy between NASA's Kepler mission and the ground-based radial velocity (RV) surveys has made ground-breaking discoveries of exoplanets, including many interesting low-mass and likely rocky planets such as Kepler-78b, the first exoplanet known to have radius and mass very close to Earth's. In the post-Kepler era, radial velocimetry will continue to play a key role in validating Kepler candidates and measuring their masses, as well as discovering exoplanets independently.

However, the current precision of radial velocimetry (0.5-1 m/s) acts as one of the major limiting factors in detecting exoplanets with even lower masses or rocky planets further out in the orbit, especially in or near the Habitable Zone. Breaking this limit is critical for enriching the diversity of the current exoplanet ensemble towards the lower mass end, and it is a necessary step towards finding Earth-mass exoplanets in the Habitable Zone around Sun-like stars, which requires an RV precision of ~0.1 m/s.

We propose to improve the RV precision of several leading RV instruments (all using the iodine RV technique), including HIRES on Keck. Keck/HIRES has contributed to a great number of validation and mass measurements of Kepler planets - including most of the small and low-mass ones with radius smaller than 2 Earth radii. As a 10-meter-class telescope, it is responsible for a majority of the RV-discovered exoplanets so far, and it is the most efficient Kepler follow-up facility. Bringing its RV precision to a new level will bring new discoveries of exoplanets with ever lower masses. Moreover, with improved RV precision, we will revisit and perform dynamic analysis on systems with multiple planets, especially the ones with small RV amplitudes, such as tau Ceti, GJ 876, upsilon Andromedae, and GJ 581.

Our work will also improve the RV precision of another 10-meter-class telescope: the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). Upon finish of its hardware upgrade this summer, HET will become the second large telescope that is capable of extensive Kepler follow-up programs. Ensuring that its RV precision is comparable to that of Keck will maximize the science return on the Kepler legacy, and will also greatly benefit the current on-going RV surveys at these large telescopes. Moreover, the proposed work will have great synergy with two other precise RV instruments on smaller telescopes, CHIRON and the upcoming MINERVA, which carry out dedicated, high-cadence RV surveys on interesting nearby stars such as tau Ceti and alpha Centauri A/B.

Our approach for improving the precision of iodine radial velocimetry is to eliminate the RV systematic errors, known as one of the two major contributors to the 'RV jitter' (the other one being the stellar jitter). Through our pilot study, we have identified several contributing factors to RV systematic errors, some of which are being recognized and studied in detail for the very first time for precise radial velocimetry with iodine. Some of these factors contribute to the RV error budget at ~1 m/s level, and thus they set the floor of long-term RV precision at 1 m/s if not carefully studied and corrected for. We propose to work on: removal of RV systematic errors / annual jitter caused by the Earth's atmospheric absorption (telluric lines); improvements in wavelength-dependent statistical weighting in spectrum for RV extraction; validation of the RV calibrator, the iodine atlas, using high-resolution echelle spectrograph; and improvements in data reduction and instrumental effect modeling for fiber-fed RV instruments.

- fig:tell: title of the third plot needs to be 'Systematics/Jitter Removed'; change barycentric correction to barycentric velocity? Or simpler, to day of year? If you don't plan to explain what the vertical dashed line is, remove it.
- fig:fts: line thickness and charsizes need to match with fig:tell.
- Section 3.3: Validating the Calibrator: the Iodine Atlas: needs to explain in first paragraph why 'calibrator'. Also trim this section down.
- Terminologies: systematic errors, RV jitter, systematic jitter, annual jitter… be consistent and be clear!
- Keck or Keck/HIRES? consistent or use Keck/HIRES only when absolutely necessary.
